# assembly-pythagorian-triple

8 bit program to check if three input numbers (0-255) are a pythagorian triple, written in assembly.

This was part of an assignment in the first year of my degree, and was provided as an extra task that did not count towards our grades. I enjoyed every one of the 51 minutes i spent on it, but wish there was more to do as my (probably insane) brain apparently loves assembly programming.

The other tasks for this assignment contained template code and required you to "complete the code", this is the only one that had just the inupt variables and a blank sheet to work from, which is why I am most proud of it. In total there were 71 assembly tasks, which I completed over 4 days, and are available in the zip file.

I wish I had commented it a bit better, but live and learn I guess.
